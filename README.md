# MongoDB_Assignment_2

Simple connection to MongoDB from either Jupyter Notebook or Python file .py, with some added queries that provide answers, 
to some of the questions in the assignment. 

Code is commented, to help populating and checking the queries using your own DB in MongoDB. 

Few notes: 
MongoDB should be installed, and/or Docker if using a VM. 
Python3 should be correctly configured + You'll need to install the "Pymongo" import, using pip. 

Bear in mind, it is still "work in progress, at this point", to figure out the last queries for the given questions,
in the assignment. Therefor it's not 100% done.
